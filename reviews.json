        "review": "Very soft spoken and introverted professor, so it's hard to hear him during the lectures. He needs to speak up and not be so shy and meek. The lectures are not helpful and makes his TAs do all the work for him. He seems to be more suited for doing research, but terrible at teaching. Class is a complete joke, would NOT recommend"

        "review": "Overall his class is ok, but Professor Nelson Max is a sensitive and bad-tempered person to homeworks and had reported roughly 40 students for plagiarism for similar work. I would not recommend his class as you have a good chance of being reported, so please beware."

He even offers extra credit if you participate in class. His midterm was difficult, but the class and homework (which are graded on completion) were incredibly interesting."

        "review": "If you went to lectures and actually understood the homework, you would do well in this class. He truly cares for his students and wants them to succeed. Don't slack on lectures because his questions are based on whether or not you showed up and paid attention."

        "review": "Pretty standard upper div CS course. The homeworks all build on each other so make sure you understand each one. The tests are pretty hard but the prof gives lots of partial credit for the free response questions. Only negative is that he occasionally is visibly disappointed with the class when only a few students answer the lecture questions."

There were weekly homework that gets progressively harder and proof heavy but graded very easily. Midterms are not too difficult and final is not cumulative, so it is not a very difficult class if your math oriented."

Condescending, forces us to add many many features when our client cares more about functionality. Threatened us with C grade for not having enough functionalities on our project.."

If you go to office hours he puts a lot of effort into helping you figure out HW problems you don't understand. Tests are not too challenging, usually based on homework problems and are slightly easier than homework. Really recommend him for ECS122A."

Lecture is not mandatory but he is good at explaining concepts and is always open to questions. However, exams are moderately difficult with the final grade being 25% midterm and 35% final."

Take advantage of the resources used - we used Latex, R studio, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook - all are amazing tools!

You can tell he cares deeply about all his students and the material as well. There is no professor at UC Davis I respect more. He is truly the goat of the the UC davis CS department"

The class isn't exactly the most organized, and the midterms are tough. He gives practice midterms which are very similar to the ones he gives in class, but he grades a bit rough. Good class"

The lecture slides and example programs provided are very useful. The four homework assignments and two midterms are relatively easy, but are graded harshly."

Although there is a good amount of work (homeworks, then project all in one quarter), if you get a good group you should be fine. Interesting lectures, and he often has personal anecdotes."

        "review": "Super passionate and genuinely cares about his students grasping concepts. Sometimes was unclear what would be covered on the tests, but if you go to Office Hours he usually tells you what content to study. Lectures aren't recorded but you can miss a few and still be alright because he goes over concepts slowly to make sure we really grasp them."

No matter where you work in the programming stack, understanding topics learned in this course is crucial to make better use of the available resources. Great readings and fair exams."
